I based this piece off of an idea I had of unity where we can all succeed together or fail alone. In recent events people have begun to come together to help each other out in times of need which helped me come up with this idea. The silhouette of people are holding hands and soaring through the galaxy to reach an Earth that looks like two hands grasping to represent unity. They help each other soar to reach the Earth instead of letting anyone fall behind. My work would live online and would be projected on a screen.<br><br></p></center>

I messed with the coding or the text on text edit a little bit to be able to achieve this little glitchy look to make the picture look unique and make it look old. I wanted to negate some of the aspects in the picture like the colorful background and the lighting of the piece. The aspect that I wanted to pull from the original piece was just the car.<br><br></p>

    Medium:Vimeo, In my laptop.<br><br>
    Duration: 1:53<br><br>
    In this video still I did a few standard cuts and a few action cuts since I wasn't able to do any audio cuts in the video. I used a bunch of pictures that were online and some that I took to create the video. The reason why I made this was because I was really excited for the new Kingsmen 2 movie that was coming out at the time so it made sense to make the video about the trailer.<br><br>

            Duration: 3:05<br><br>
            For this piece I created a bunch of drum beats and some old recordings with a friend of mine and pieced them together in premiere pro to make this sound. I went with a different approach from all the static sounds and such to get a beat that I like a lot. I used a beatpad and the beatpad pro software to create the beats and a few other samples.<br><br>

                Medium: github<br><br>
                Keith and Mendi Obadike made a piece where they were selling Blackness. I wanted to recreate the piece using a different tone of skin. I thought of yellow because there are people who make fun of myself and fellow asians for our skin color. People would call asians as yellows or chinks all the time. I wanted to recreate an ebay page where you would be able to bid on the color of my skin and step into an asian's perspective. I wanted to sell my skin so that way the people saying all these harmful things will experience it when other people say the same things back to them. It's similar to what the Obadikes wanted to achieve in their piece.<br><br>

                    I took this picture while I was out with my friends. We drove by a liquor store and I noticed that it had nice lighting next to the door of the store. So my friends and I drove our cars up next to the door and took turns taking pictures of it. It was kind of an impulse motive and we were kinda just in the right place at the right time.<br><br>
